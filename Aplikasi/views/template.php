				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>After looking for a decent admin template and not having any success I decided to knock this one up. It's released under the creative commons license, so make sure you look at that before using it in your project.</p>
				<h3>Credits</h3>
				<p>I would like to thank Nathan Smith for creating the 960.gs CSS framework which made this project a <i>little</i> easier.</p>
